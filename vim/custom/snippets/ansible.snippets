In 1.8 and above, ansible adapts to the new slack API where tokens look like C(G922VJP24/D921DW937/3Ffe373sfhRE6y42Fg3rvf4GlK).  If tokens are in the new format then slack will ignore any value of domain.  If the token is in the old format the domain is required.  Ansible has no control of when slack will get rid of the old API.  When slack does that the old format will stop working.  ** Please keep in mind the tokens are not the API tokens but are the webhook tokens.  In slack these are found in the webhook URL which are obtained under the apps and integrations. The incoming webhooks can be added in that area.  In some cases this may be locked by your Slack admin and you must request access.  It is there that the incoming webhooks can be added.  The key is on the end of the URL given to you in that section.}

		# diff_ignore_lines: # Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically updated by the system. This argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line matches.
		# intended_config: # The C(intended_config) provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against. This argument will not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against. When specifying this argument, the task should also modify the C(diff_against) value and set it to I(intended).
		# backup_options: # This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when C(backup) is set to I(yes), if C(backup) is set to I(no) this option will be silently ignored.

The path to the source file can either be the full path on the Ansible control host or a relative path from the playbook or role root directory. This argument is mutually exclusive with I(lines), I(parents).

There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook. The I(running_config) argument allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.

		# diff_against: running|startup|intended
		# diff_ignore_lines: # Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically updated by the system. This argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line matches.
		# intended_config: # The C(intended_config) provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against. This argument will not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against. When specifying this argument, the task should also modify the C(diff_against) value and set it to I(intended).
		# backup_options: # This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when C(backup) is set to I(yes), if C(backup) is set to I(no) this option will be silently ignored.

snippet vdo "Module to control VDO" b
- name: $1
	vdo:
		name: ${2:# The name of the VDO volume.}
		state: ${3:absent|#present}
		# activated: # The "activate" status for a VDO volume.  If this is set to "no", the VDO volume cannot be started, and it will not start on system startup.  However, on initial creation, a VDO volume with "activated" set to "off" will be running, until stopped.  This is the default behavior of the "vdo create" command; it provides the user an opportunity to write a base amount of metadata (filesystem, LVM headers, etc.) to the VDO volume prior to stopping the volume, and leaving it deactivated until ready to use.
		# running: # Whether this VDO volume is running.
		# device: # The full path of the device to use for VDO storage.
		# logicalsize: # The logical size of the VDO volume (in megabytes, or LVM suffix format).  If not specified for a new volume, this defaults to the same size as the underlying storage device, which is specified in the 'device' parameter. Existing volumes will maintain their size if the logicalsize parameter is not specified, or is smaller than or identical to the current size.  If the specified size is larger than the current size, a growlogical operation will be performed.
		# deduplication: disabled|enabled
		# compression: disabled|enabled
		# blockmapcachesize: # The amount of memory allocated for caching block map pages, in megabytes (or may be issued with an LVM-style suffix of K, M, G, or T).  The default (and minimum) value is 128M.  The value specifies the size of the cache; there is a 15% memory usage overhead. Each 1.25G of block map covers 1T of logical blocks, therefore a small amount of block map cache memory can cache a significantly large amount of block map data.  Existing volumes will maintain their previously configured setting unless a different value is specified in the playbook.
		# readcache: disabled|enabled
		# readcachesize: # Specifies the extra VDO device read cache size in megabytes.  This is in addition to a system-defined minimum.  Using a value with a suffix of K, M, G, or T is optional.  The default value is 0.  1.125 MB of memory per bio thread will be used per 1 MB of read cache specified (for example, a VDO volume configured with 4 bio threads will have a read cache memory usage overhead of 4.5 MB per 1 MB of read cache specified). Existing volumes will maintain their previously configured setting unless a different value is specified in the playbook.
		# emulate512: # Enables 512-byte emulation mode, allowing drivers or filesystems to access the VDO volume at 512-byte granularity, instead of the default 4096-byte granularity. Default is 'disabled'; only recommended when a driver or filesystem requires 512-byte sector level access to a device.  This option is only available when creating a new volume, and cannot be changed for an existing volume.
		# growphysical: no
		# slabsize: # The size of the increment by which the physical size of a VDO volume is grown, in megabytes (or may be issued with an LVM-style suffix of K, M, G, or T).  Must be a power of two between 128M and 32G.  The default is 2G, which supports volumes having a physical size up to 16T. The maximum, 32G, supports a physical size of up to 256T. This option is only available when creating a new volume, and cannot be changed for an existing volume.
		# writepolicy: async|auto|sync
		# indexmem: # Specifies the amount of index memory in gigabytes.  The default is 0.25.  The special decimal values 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 can be used, as can any positive integer. This option is only available when creating a new volume, and cannot be changed for an existing volume.
		# indexmode: dense|sparse
		# ackthreads: # Specifies the number of threads to use for acknowledging completion of requested VDO I/O operations. Valid values are integer values from 1 to 100 (lower numbers are preferable due to overhead).  The default is 1.  Existing volumes will maintain their previously configured setting unless a different value is specified in the playbook.
		# biothreads: # Specifies the number of threads to use for submitting I/O operations to the storage device.  Valid values are integer values from 1 to 100 (lower numbers are preferable due to overhead).  The default is 4. Existing volumes will maintain their previously configured setting unless a different value is specified in the playbook.
		# cputhreads: # Specifies the number of threads to use for CPU-intensive work such as hashing or compression.  Valid values are integer values from 1 to 100 (lower numbers are preferable due to overhead).  The default is 2. Existing volumes will maintain their previously configured setting unless a different value is specified in the playbook.
		# logicalthreads: # Specifies the number of threads across which to subdivide parts of the VDO processing based on logical block addresses.  Valid values are integer values from 1 to 100 (lower numbers are preferable due to overhead). The default is 1.  Existing volumes will maintain their previously configured setting unless a different value is specified in the playbook.
		# physicalthreads: # Specifies the number of threads across which to subdivide parts of the VDO processing based on physical block addresses.  Valid values are integer values from 1 to 16 (lower numbers are preferable due to overhead). The physical space used by the VDO volume must be larger than (slabsize * physicalthreads).  The default is 1.  Existing volumes will maintain their previously configured setting unless a different value is specified in the playbook.
