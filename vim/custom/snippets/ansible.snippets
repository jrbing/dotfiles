snippet iptables "Modify the systems iptables" b
- name: $1
	iptables:
		# tcp_flags: {}
		# comment: # This specifies a comment that will be added to the rule
		# protocol: # The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check. The specified protocol can be one of tcp, udp, udplite, icmp, esp, ah, sctp or the special keyword "all", or it can be a numeric value, representing one of these protocols or a different one. A protocol name from /etc/protocols is also allowed. A "!" argument before the protocol inverts the test.  The number zero is equivalent to all. "all" will match with all protocols and is taken as default when this option is omitted.
		# chain: # Chain to operate on. This option can either be the name of a user defined chain or any of the builtin chains: 'INPUT', 'FORWARD', 'OUTPUT', 'PREROUTING', 'POSTROUTING', 'SECMARK', 'CONNSECMARK'.
		# out_interface: # Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets entering the FORWARD, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING chains). When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this name will match. If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.
		# limit_burst: # Specifies the maximum burst before the above limit kicks in.
		# ctstate: []
		# jump: # This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the packet matches it. The target can be a user-defined chain (other than the one this rule is in), one of the special builtin targets which decide the fate of the packet immediately, or an extension (see EXTENSIONS below).  If this option is omitted in a rule (and the goto parameter is not used), then matching the rule will have no effect on the packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will be incremented.
		# to_ports: # This specifies a destination port or range of ports to use: without this, the destination port is never altered. This is only valid if the rule also specifies one of the following protocols: tcp, udp, dccp or sctp.
		# flush: # Flushes the specified table and chain of all rules. If no chain is specified then the entire table is purged. Ignores all other parameters.
		# table: #filter|nat|mangle|raw|security
		# icmp_type: # This allows specification of the ICMP type, which can be a numeric ICMP type, type/code pair, or one of the ICMP type names shown by the command 'iptables -p icmp -h'
		# to_destination: # This specifies a destination address to use with DNAT: without this, the destination address is never altered.
		# uid_owner: # Specifies the UID or username to use in match by owner rule.
		# set_dscp_mark_class: # This allows specifying a predefined DiffServ class which will be translated to the corresponding DSCP mark. Mutually exclusive with C(set_dscp_mark).
		# destination: # Destination specification. Address can be either a network name, a hostname, a network IP address (with /mask), or a plain IP address. Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule is submitted to the kernel. Please note that specifying any name to be resolved with a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea. The mask can be either a network mask or a plain number, specifying the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask. Thus, a mask of 24 is equivalent to 255.255.255.0. A "!" argument before the address specification inverts the sense of the address.
		# set_dscp_mark: # This allows specifying a DSCP mark to be added to packets. It takes either an integer or hex value. Mutually exclusive with C(set_dscp_mark_class).
		# source: # Source specification. Address can be either a network name, a hostname, a network IP address (with /mask), or a plain IP address. Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule is submitted to the kernel. Please note that specifying any name to be resolved with a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea. The mask can be either a network mask or a plain number, specifying the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask. Thus, a mask of 24 is equivalent to 255.255.255.0. A "!" argument before the address specification inverts the sense of the address.
		# state: #present|absent
		# policy: # Set the policy for the chain to the given target. Valid targets are ACCEPT, DROP, QUEUE, RETURN. Only built in chains can have policies. This parameter requires the chain parameter. Ignores all other parameters.
		# set_counters: # This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte counters of a rule (during INSERT, APPEND, REPLACE operations).
		# match: []
		# goto: # This specifies that the processing should continue in a user specified chain. Unlike the jump argument return will not continue processing in this chain but instead in the chain that called us via jump.
		# fragment: # This means that the rule only refers to second and further fragments of fragmented packets. Since there is no way to tell the source or destination ports of such a packet (or ICMP type), such a packet will not match any rules which specify them. When the "!" argument precedes fragment argument, the rule will only match head fragments, or unfragmented packets.
		# to_source: # This specifies a source address to use with SNAT: without this, the source address is never altered.
		# in_interface: # Name of an interface via which a packet was received (only for packets entering the INPUT, FORWARD and PREROUTING chains). When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this name will match. If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.
		# source_port: # Source port or port range specification. This can either be a service name or a port number. An inclusive range can also be specified, using the format first:last. If the first port is omitted, '0' is assumed; if the last is omitted, '65535' is assumed. If the first port is greater than the second one they will be swapped.
		# destination_port: # Destination port or port range specification. This can either be a service name or a port number. An inclusive range can also be specified, using the format first:last. If the first port is omitted, '0' is assumed; if the last is omitted, '65535' is assumed. If the first port is greater than the second one they will be swapped.
		# reject_with: # Specifies the error packet type to return while rejecting.
		# limit: # Specifies the maximum average number of matches to allow per second. The number can specify units explicitly, using `/second', `/minute', `/hour' or `/day', or parts of them (so `5/second' is the same as `5/s').
